Description: http://www.innerbreed.co.uk
Version: V1.0
Start Date: 24/12/2017
Developer/s: Jonny Poole (aka Innerbreed)

FEATURES: Servo Easing applied for joint compliance.

Engineer / Developers notes:
ServoEaser library for Arduino

2011, TeamPneumo, Tod E. Kurt, http://todbot.com/blog/
ServoEaser is an Arduino library makes doing animation-style movements with
servos easier.

Features:

Supports directly telling a servo to ease to a position over a duration
Supports playing of previously-defined "move lists"
User-specified easing functions (defaults to easeInOutCubic), see Easing lib
User-specified "servo arrived" function for async callback when movement done
Supports both integer angle movement and a "microseconds" mode for fine-grained control with float-ing point angles
